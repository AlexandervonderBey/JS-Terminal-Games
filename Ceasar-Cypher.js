/* 
Caesar Cipher
Description: Implement a basic Caesar Cipher encryption.
Requirements:
The program should take a phrase and a shift number as inputs from process.argv.
Encrypt the phrase by shifting each letter, based on its position in the english alphabet, by the specified number.
Case insensitive
A negative shift means shift to the left
A positive shift means shift to the right
Output the encrypted phrase to the console.
Example:
node caesarCipher.js "hello world" 3
# Output: khoor zruog
